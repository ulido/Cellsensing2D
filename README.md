# Particle fluxes to small windows in two dimensions (receptors and cell sensing)

This repository contains the code used in the publication U. Dobramysl, D. Holcman, Mixed analytical-stochastic simulation method for the recovery of a Brownian gradient source from probability fluxes to small windows, Journal of Computational Physics 355 (2018). Specifically, it contains the code to calculate the analytical expression for the particle fluxes to N small windows in two-dimensional half-space and a reflecting disk. Furthermore, it contains the code to perform hybrid analytical-stochastic particle-based simulations in two-dimensional half-space, the reflecting disk and a disk in a reflecting strip. Jupyter Notebooks are included to illustrate the use of the code.
